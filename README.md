# Global-Financial-Markets-and-Instruments
This repository includes the code I created when I was taking the course on Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-financial-markets-instruments

ðŸ˜Š I'm excited to share my new certification from Coursera: Global Financial Markets and Instruments! I earned the certificate on July 1st, 2023. A happy Canada Day to myself! The certificate can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/BYQH4FEQ3NMM
ðŸ“— The course helped me to understand some essential topics better! It started with the basic finance concepts and tools, such as the time value of money, computing returns, discounting and compounding. It was followed by two modules on fixed-income securities, equity securities and derivatives. Finally, I learned different trading venues and the mechanics of securities trading, including various types of orders, and transactions like margin buying and short-selling.
ðŸ’» Some quiz questions are challenging, so I used MATLAB to help with the calculations and will share the code on my GitHub.
